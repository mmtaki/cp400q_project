1.when you view the answer, and rotate the device in CheatActivity and press back.
This is solved by adding the savedInstanceState in the onCreate.
If this is not null, it can retrieve saved data from the onSaveInstanceState method override.
So we save the boolean that says if they have cheated, so even on a device rotate we still know that they cheated.

2.when pressing next, you can cheat again when you get back to the question.
This is solved by saving a has cheated value for each question using a boolean array.
This is saved using onSaveInstanceState method override as well so it is not reset on a device rotate.

3.when users get back to QuizActivity, the user can rotate the device to reset the boolean value mIsCheater.
This is solved by adding the savedInstanceState in the onCreate.
This boolean is saved using the onSaveInstanceState method override, so on a device rotate, the value is not lost.
